We are Team Soft Serve, a group of developers that have made this Ice Cream Shop locator app. This app will allow you to keep a log of where you went and rate what your experience was.

Team Rules:
Use kindness to communicate, not bosyy, and use charitable assumptions.
Help each other when someone is stuck. Use a variety of mobbing, paired, and individual programming. We wil have daily meetings, a stand-up in the morning and a closing reflection time. For any personal conflicts we will call time out and take 5 minutes and re-address. 
For coding issues we will give ourselves 15 mins to debug after we will ask a TA for help. 
Our schedule will be 9-6 with a lunch break and some flexibility for looking at the code.
We will not be working on the app outside of these hours unless we have permission form the team. We will have merge parties and work as a team throughout the day.
